# Khalti Payment Gateway
Official plugin for WHMCS

## Installation
1. Download the ZIP (or tar.gz) file from the releases [See the releases](https://github.com/khalti/whmcs-khaltigateway-plugin/releases)
2. Simply extract at the root folder of your WHMCS installation. Following files will be copied

## File Structure
```
modules / 
 | gateways / 
   | khaltigateway.php
   | callback / 
       | khaltigateway.php
   | khaltigateway / 
      | common.php
      | index.php
      | init.php
      | step2.php
```
   (Basically, the plugin creates 
   - file khaltigateway.php under modules/gateways directory of your root installation,
   - directory khaltigateway/ under modules/gateways directory of your root installation
   - file khaltigateway.php under modules/gateways/callback directory of your root installation. (This file is kept just to maintain the convention that WHMCS suggests)
   
## Activate
Login to admin area of your WHMCS installation and enable the gateway from 
``Setup -> Payments -> Payment Gateways``
